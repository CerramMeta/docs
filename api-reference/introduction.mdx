## General API Information

-   The following base endpoints are available. Please use whichever works best for your setup:

    -   **[https://api.crmclick.io](https://api.crmclick.io)**

## HTTP Return Codes

-   HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
-   HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
-   HTTP `409` return code is used when a cancelReplace order partially succeeds. (i.e. if the cancellation of the order fails but the new order placement succeeds.)
-   HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
-   HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
-   HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.

## Error Codes

-   Any endpoint can return an ERROR

Sample Payload below:

```
{ "code":0, "msg":"Invalid symbol." }
```

## General Information on Endpoints

-   For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
-   For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a `query string` or in the `request body` with content type `application/json`. You may mix parameters between both the `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
-   Parameters may be sent in any order.
-   If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the `query string` parameter will be used.
